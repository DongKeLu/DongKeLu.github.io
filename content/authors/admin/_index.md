    summary: |
      - Developed and trained a three-layer Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) to forecast key macroeconomic variables, including employment, CPI, and industrial production.
      - Employed the Pyro framework and NUTS sampler to estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters, effectively handling small sample datasets and quantifying prediction uncertainty.
      - The model architecture, comprising an input layer, two hidden layers with sigmoid activation, and an output layer, demonstrated superior predictive performance, offering a novel solution for macroeconomic forecasting.
  - title: Robust Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (STGNN) for GDP Prediction

    summary: |
      - Created a GDP prediction model based on Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNN) to process dynamic trade data.
      - Designed a robust STGNN architecture capable of handling noisy and incomplete data while capturing complex spatiotemporal relationships.
      - Utilized a graph structure with 6-dimensional node features and 22-dimensional directed edge features to ensure model robustness and performance.
      - Modeled international trade relationships through graph structures and trained the model with multi-time-step data to achieve precise GDP predictions, providing a powerful tool for macroeconomic analysis.
